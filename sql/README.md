**Question:**  
Does marketing engagement reduce customer churn?

**Approach:**

- Visualized results in Tableau using LOD expressions

**Finding:**  
Customers with **no marketing touchpoints** show a **~50% churn rate**, while customers exposed to **at least one marketing channel** show a significantly lower churn rate of **~30%**.

**Business Implication:**  
Even minimal marketing engagement can substantially reduce churn.  
This insight supports prioritizing outreach campaigns for customers with zero engagement to improve retention.
